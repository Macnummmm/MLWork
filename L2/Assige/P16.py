Saffirâ€“Simpson scale assign category to a storm
according to wind speed:
>= 252 km/h as Category 5, 209-251 km/h as Category 4,
178-208 km/h as Category 3, 155-177 km/h as Category 2,
119-153 km/h as Category 1.
Also, storm with wind speed 63-118 km/h is classified
as Tropical Storm and one with wind speed <= 62 km/h
is classified as Tropical Depression.

Write a function named typhoon to take in 4 arguments:
wind speed (in Km/h), air density (in Kg/m3),
effective area (in Km2), and effective height (in m),
find its category and estimated energy,
return a list of category name and estimated energy.
